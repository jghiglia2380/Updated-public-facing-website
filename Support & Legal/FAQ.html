          <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm">
            PFL Academy covers 15 core standards of personal financial literacy — from careers, taxes, and investing to credit, insurance, and consumer protection. Our hands-on approach blends interactive tools, real-world simulations, and a two-day model: Day 1 for instruction, Day 2 for application. Students will complete auto-graded activities, skill builders, and learning labs. They’ll walk away with a professional resume, a completed financial portfolio, and a capstone project demonstrating their mastery of real-life financial decision-making. These outcomes are designed to prepare them for postsecondary life, employment, and responsible adult choices.
